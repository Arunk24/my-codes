Dense embeddings represent words or phrases as dense vectors, where all dimensions have non-zero values. Rasa Pro leverages dense embeddings in several ways:

Pre-trained Language Models: Rasa Pro utilizes pre-trained language models like BERT or RoBERTa, which provide powerful dense embeddings for words and sentences.
Custom Embedding Layers: Rasa Pro allows you to create custom embedding layers within your NLU pipeline. These layers can learn dense embeddings tailored to your specific domain and dataset.
Dialogue Management: Dense embeddings can represent dialogue history, improving the dialogue manager's decision-making.
While sparse embeddings are efficient, dense embeddings often offer superior performance, especially for complex language understanding tasks. By effectively combining both techniques, Rasa Pro can build robust and accurate conversational AI systems.
