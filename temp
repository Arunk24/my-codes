VADER Sentiment Analysis is a tool for quickly identifying the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of text. It stands for Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner. VADER uses a pre-built lexicon with words assigned sentiment scores based on their emotional tone (e.g., "happy" is positive, "sad" is negative).

Key features include:

Handling punctuation and capitalization (e.g., "GREAT!" is more positive than "great").
Understanding intensity modifiers like "very" or "slightly" to adjust sentiment strength.
Recognizing emojis, slang, and abbreviations (e.g., "lol" or ":-)").
