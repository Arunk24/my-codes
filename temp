The CRFEntityExtractor in Rasa Pro uses Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for named entity recognition (NER), extracting custom entities like locations or cuisines from user messages. It employs the BILOU tagging scheme to handle single- and multi-word entities, relying on components like WhitespaceTokenizer, RegexFeaturizer, and CountVectorsFeaturizer for preprocessing.
How It Works
Preprocessing: Tokenizes and featurizes text, generating features like case, part-of-speech, or regex matches.

Training: Uses sklearn_crfsuite to train on annotated YAML data, learning to assign BILOU tags.

Prediction: Outputs entities with confidence scores, e.g., { "value": "mexican", "entity": "cuisine", "confidence": 0.854 }.
