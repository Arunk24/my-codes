Graded Quiz: Clustering
The objective of k-means clustering is: 

Separate dissimilar samples and group similar ones--correct


 Which option correctly orders the steps of k-means clustering? 
 
 Re-cluster the data points Choose k random observations to calculate each clusterâ€™s mean Update centroid to take cluster mean Repeat until centroids are constant Calculate data point distance to centroids 

2, 5, 3, 1, 4--correct

Question 3 How can we gauge the performance of a k-means clustering model when ground truth is not available? 

Calculate the number of incorrectly classified observations in the training set. --incorrect
Determine the prediction accuracy on the test set.--incorrect
Take the average of the distance between data points and their cluster centroids.--correct


4. Question 4 When the parameter K for k-means clustering increases, what happens to the error?

It might increase or decrease depending on if data points are closer to the centroid. --incorrect
It will increase because incorrectly classified points are further from the correct centroid.--incorrect
It will decrease because distance between data points and centroid will decrease.--correct

5. Question 5 Which of the following is true for partition-based clustering but not hierarchical nor density-based clustering algorithms? 

Partition-based clustering can handle spatial clusters and noisy data.--incorrect
Partition-based clustering is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm. -- incorrect

Partition-based clustering produces sphere-like clusters. --correct
